# Tribute-Page
This tribute page is using basic html and css for someone who meant the world to me. This person was the reason why I have my love for technology today and why I feel like this is the first thing I could think of, when it came to a project.
This project will consist of several different sections that explain who this person is and how they impacted people around them.

This page will consist of a brief summary of the person, a list of hobbies, and other things.
